    <small>A message from our lead technician</small>
    <h2>Why I started this pool service</h2>
    <p>After spending $8,000 to repair my pool pump (damaged by improper chemical balance), I realized how expensive DIY pool care mistakes can be. That's why I built a service that makes professional pool maintenance affordable for every pool owner in Columbus. Today, we maintain over 200 pools and have saved our clients thousands in prevented repairs.</p>
