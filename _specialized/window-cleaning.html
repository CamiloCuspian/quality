faqs:
  - pregunta: How often should I have my windows professionally cleaned?
    respuesta: For homes, we recommend twice a year (spring and fall). Commercial properties typically need monthly or quarterly service depending on location and environmental factors.
  - pregunta: Do you clean windows in bad weather?
    respuesta: We monitor weather conditions closely and reschedule if conditions aren't safe or would compromise results. You'll never pay for a cleaning that doesn't meet our standards.
  - pregunta: Are you insured for high-rise cleaning?
    respuesta: Yes! We carry $2 million in liability insurance and full workers' compensation. All our high-rise specialists are OSHA certified and use state-of-the-art safety equipment.
  - pregunta: What's included in a standard window cleaning?
    respuesta: We clean both sides of glass, frames, tracks, and screens. We also wipe down sills and remove any cobwebs around windows at no extra charge.

    <small>A personal story from Mike, our lead technician</small>
    <h2>Why window cleaning became my obsession</h2>
    <p>Twenty years ago, I was working in a downtown Columbus office. Every day, I'd stare through grimy windows, feeling like I was missing out on life. When I finally had them cleaned, the difference in workplace morale was immediate. That day, I discovered my calling - bringing that "wow" moment to others. Two decades later, we've transformed over 1,000 Columbus properties, from historic homes to modern high-rises.</p>
