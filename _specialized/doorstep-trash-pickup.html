    <small>A message from our founder</small>
    <h2>Why I started this service</h2>
    <p>After throwing my back out dragging heavy trash bins down my steep driveway (and missing collection day for the third time that month), I realized there had to be a better way. Today, we serve over 1,000 Columbus homes with doorstep collection, making trash day a thing of the past for busy families, seniors, and anyone who values their time and convenience.</p>
