faqs:
  - pregunta: How much does doorstep trash pickup cost in Columbus?
    respuesta: Our standard Columbus doorstep trash pickup service starts at $29/month for weekly collection. Additional pickups or special waste removal available from $15 per pickup. All plans include complimentary bin cleaning. We're more convenient than standard Columbus trash services while remaining affordable for most households.
  - pregunta: What's the difference between your service and Columbus 311 trash pickup?
    respuesta: Unlike the city's 311 trash pickup service in Columbus Ohio, we collect directly from your doorstep, garage, or preferred location - no dragging bins to the curb. We offer flexible scheduling (including evenings and weekends), provide guaranteed service regardless of holidays or weather, and include free bin cleaning. We're also able to handle bulk trash pickup in Columbus with just 24 hours notice, compared to the city's typical 2-4 week wait.
  - pregunta: Do you offer bulk trash pickup in Columbus Ohio?
    respuesta: Yes! We provide on-demand large trash pickup in Columbus Ohio for items like furniture, appliances, and electronics. Our bulk trash collection starts at $45 per item with eco-friendly disposal guaranteed. Unlike the city's bulk pickup program, we don't require items to be placed at the curb - we'll collect from anywhere on your property with just 24 hours notice.
  - pregunta: What days do you provide trash pickup in Columbus?
    respuesta: We offer flexible trash pickup schedules 7 days a week throughout Columbus Ohio. Choose your preferred collection day and time window - morning (7-11 AM), afternoon (12-4 PM), or evening (5-8 PM). Unlike standard Columbus trash service schedules that assign your day, we work around YOUR schedule.
  - pregunta: What types of waste does your Columbus trash service collect?
    respuesta: Our comprehensive Columbus trash service collects household trash, recyclables, and yard waste. Special waste (electronics, furniture, appliances) can be arranged with 24-hour notice. We also handle hazardous materials that many Columbus Ohio trash pickup services won't accept, though additional fees may apply for proper disposal.
  - pregunta: Do I need to be home when you provide trash pickup service?
    respuesta: No! That's the convenience of our doorstep trash pickup in Columbus Ohio. Just leave your trash in your designated area (garage, side door, etc.) and we'll handle the rest. You'll receive a photo confirmation after each collection, so you always know your trash pickup service has been completed.
