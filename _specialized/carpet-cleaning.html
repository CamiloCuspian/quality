    <small>A message from our founder</small>
    <h2>Why I started this carpet cleaning service</h2>
    <p>Last year, my daughter spilled grape juice all over our new cream carpet. After spending hundreds on "professional" cleaners who left it worse than before, I realized Columbus needed better. That's why I built this company - to deliver the results I couldn't find myself.</p>
