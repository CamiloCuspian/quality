  - pregunta: How much does professional carpet cleaning cost in Columbus?
    respuesta: Our residential carpet cleaning starts at $129 for three rooms, making us one of the most competitive professional carpet cleaning services in Columbus Ohio. We offer transparent pricing with no hidden fees, and you'll get an exact quote before we begin. Commercial carpet cleaning is priced by square footage with discounts for regular maintenance plans.
  - pregunta: Do you offer same-day carpet cleaning in Columbus?
    respuesta: Yes! We're one of the few companies offering genuine same-day carpet cleaning in Columbus Ohio. Call before noon Monday through Saturday, and we'll have your carpets clean and fresh today - with no additional rush charges. We maintain multiple crews throughout the Columbus area to ensure prompt service.
  - pregunta: How long does carpet cleaning take to dry?

  - pregunta: Do you remove tough stains like wine, coffee or pet accidents?
    respuesta: Absolutely! Our specialized stain removal process tackles the most stubborn spots Columbus homeowners face - from red wine and coffee to pet accidents and ground-in dirt. We use a proprietary multi-stage treatment for difficult stains that other Columbus carpet cleaners often claim are permanent. If we can't remove it, you don't pay for that area.

    respuesta: We provide carpet cleaning services throughout all Columbus neighborhoods and surrounding areas including Worthington, Dublin, Westerville, Gahanna, New Albany, Upper Arlington, Blacklick, Canal Winchester, Grandview, and Hilliard.
