    <small>A message from Sarah, our lead technician</small>
    <h2>Why I became obsessed with clean upholstery</h2>
    <p>Last summer, my three-year-old decided to "paint" our brand-new $2,000 sectional with chocolate milk. Three different cleaning companies told me it was ruined. That's when I discovered the advanced cleaning techniques that now form the core of our service. Not only did we save my sofa, but I found my calling - helping Columbus families preserve their cherished furniture investments.</p>

    <h2>Why your furniture deserves better</h2>
    <p>Think about it - your furniture witnesses every moment of your life. Family game nights. Movie marathons. Quick naps that turn into hours. <strong>But over time, it collects more than just memories</strong>.</p>
    <p>We regularly hear customers say:</p>
    <ul class="about_list">
      <li><span>üòü</span> "I'm embarrassed to have guests over because of my sofa"</li>
      <li><span>ü§ß</span> "My allergies are worse when I sit in my favorite chair"</li>
      <li><span>üêæ</span> "I can't get rid of the pet smell no matter what I try"</li>
      <li><span>‚òπÔ∏è</span> "I'm thinking of replacing furniture I still love"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don't have to live with these problems. And you definitely don't need to replace furniture that just needs some professional care.</p>
