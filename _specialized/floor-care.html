    <small>A message from our chief technician</small>
    <h2>Why I became obsessed with truly clean floors</h2>
    <p>When my daughter started crawling, I noticed her white onesies would turn gray within minutes on our "clean" floors. Regular mopping wasn't enough. That's when I discovered the science behind truly clean floors - it's not just about what you see, but what you don't. Now, I help Columbus families create safer, cleaner spaces from the ground up.</p>
