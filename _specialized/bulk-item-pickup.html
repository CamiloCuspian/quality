      <small>A message from our Columbus team</small>
      <h2>Columbus bulk pick up service we offer</h2>
      <p>After watching my elderly neighbor struggle to dispose of an old mattress (and getting fined by the city for leaving it at the curb), I realized Columbus needed a better solution for bulk item removal. Today, we've helped over 5,000 Columbus residents properly dispose of large items, with 80% of materials being recycled or donated rather than landfilled.</p>
